🛡️ Final Capstone Activity – Penetration Testing & Capture the Flag
📌 Overview
This repository documents my Final Capstone Activity for a cybersecurity course, focused on performing a full-scope penetration test within a controlled and authorized lab environment. The project follows the structure of a Capture the Flag (CTF) exercise and demonstrates the practical application of ethical hacking techniques from reconnaissance through exploitation and remediation.
All activities were conducted strictly for educational purposes in a simulated environment.

🎯 Objectives
The primary goal of this capstone is to simulate a real-world penetration testing engagement by:
•	Conducting reconnaissance to identify potential attack surfaces
•	Discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities across multiple systems
•	Locating and capturing hidden flag files as proof of successful exploitation
•	Documenting findings and proposing remediation strategies to secure vulnerable systems
This assessment emphasizes persistence, problem-solving, and methodical testing—core skills required in professional penetration testing.

🧩 Challenge Breakdown
The capstone consists of four progressive challenges:
🔹 Challenge 1: SQL Injection
•	Identify and exploit an SQL injection vulnerability
•	Extract sensitive information to locate a flag file
🔹 Challenge 2: Web Server Vulnerabilities
•	Investigate misconfigurations and exposed directories
•	Leverage web server weaknesses to uncover a flag file
🔹 Challenge 3: Samba Share Exploitation
•	Enumerate open Samba (SMB) shares
•	Access shared resources to retrieve a flag file
🔹 Challenge 4: Network Traffic Analysis
•	Analyze a provided Wireshark capture file
•	Identify the location of a file containing flag information

🧠 Background & Scenario
In this simulated engagement, I was tasked with acting as an ethical penetration tester hired by a customer. The customer requested a comprehensive security assessment covering:
•	Discovered vulnerabilities
•	Successfully exploited weaknesses
•	Recommended remediation steps to reduce future risk
The scope of the assessment included systems within the following network ranges:
•	10.5.5.0
•	192.168.0.0/24

🧪 Methodology
The engagement followed a standard penetration testing lifecycle:
1.	Reconnaissance & Enumeration
2.	Vulnerability Identification
3.	Exploitation & Flag Capture
4.	Analysis & Documentation
5.	Remediation Recommendations
A trial-and-error approach was expected, reinforcing the importance of adaptability and persistence in offensive security work.
